Mass rapid transit system Dhaka Metro Rail 

Our project is like a little Dhaka city on a computer screen using a special toolkit called GLUT in C++. We made roads with moving cars, tall and short buildings, and a metro rail. There's a sun and a moon in the sky, and fluffy clouds that move. Birds fly around too!
